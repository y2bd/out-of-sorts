* Probably all on a grid
* TODO Support bridges?
* Two resolver colors, red and blue
- final train is gold
- need to get gold into exit
- how do we handle splits? which side is success and which side is failure
- maybe set up like T junction
- stem is input, left turn is consume, right turn is don't?
- wait, why even bother making two outputs, it can always just pass through if it's not right
* two kids passing trains back and forth
- simon and mali
- mali has all the trains
- simon has nothing
- simon is spoiled, and only wants certain configurations of trains
* cool t-junction block that allows you to create loops
- what if instead it's always LU are inputs, R is success, D is failure
